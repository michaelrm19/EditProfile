## User Instructions

Here are instructions on how to run this mobile application on MacOS. Please make sure that your MacOS is updated to 13.5 or later in order to run XCode.
1. Clone this project.
2. Install XCode 15. https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12
3. Once Installed, launch XCode so that it can complete its first launch.
4. A dialog will be presented that indicates which Simulator runtimes are built-in and which Simulator runtimes you may download. Please make sure you have the iOS Simulators downloaded to run a simulation of the mobile application.
5. Once set up, Open EditProfile in XCode.
6. On the top navigation bar, click on Product -> Destination -> Under iOS Simulators, select iPhone 15 and make sure this is checkmarked.
7. On the top navigation bar, click on Product -> Run. The iOS iphone 15 simulator should show up on your screen. Please be patient and wait for the mobile application to finish loading.
8. Important Notes: When running, there may be ~10 ignorable warnings related to segues and custom segues. Please ignore these 10 warnings. The iPhone 15 simulator may take a while to boot up the EditProfile mobile application for the first time. When booting or loading the mobile application, it is completely normal for the iPhone simulator to show a blank white screen (signaling that EditProfile is running and trying to load the mobile application). Bringing up your photo library when updating your profile picture or bringing up the iPhone keyboard when editting first name, last name, bio, etc. may be slow dependent on how powerful your MacOS device is / the device you are using to run the iOS simulator. The overall "speed" of the simulation will depend on your MacOS device, so please be patient! All of the functionalities expected of this mobile application have been tested and are fully functional. Data will not be stored or saved in a database, so the application will completely refresh if you completely restart the mobile application.
